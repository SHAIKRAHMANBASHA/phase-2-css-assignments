        External CSS is used to style multiple HTML pages with a single style sheet. External CSS contains a separate
        CSS file with a .css extension. The CSS file contains style properties added on selectors (For example class,
        id, heading, … etc.).

        How to Link a CSS File to an HTML File ?
        To link a CSS file to an HTML file, use the link element within the HTML file’s head section with the rel
        attribute set to “stylesheet” and the href attribute specifying the CSS file’s path.

        CSS property is written in a separate file with a .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using
        a link tag. External CSS sets styles for elements once and applies them consistently across multiple web pages,
        ensuring a unified design.
